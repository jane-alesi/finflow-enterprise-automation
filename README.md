# FinFlow - Enterprise Financial Workflow Automation Platform

This repository contains the open-source enterprise financial workflow automation platform, **FinFlow**, designed specifically for tier-1 banks and financial institutions. Our approach is workflow-first, compliance-native, and legacy-friendly, addressing the critical need for reliable and auditable automation in complex financial environments.

## Vision
To provide a robust, scalable, and transparent platform that enables financial institutions to automate complex workflows, manage regulatory compliance, and integrate seamlessly with existing legacy systems, moving beyond "demo-ware" to deliver real business value.

## Key Principles
- **Workflow-First**: Focus on orchestrating business processes rather than standalone AI agents.
- **Compliance-Native**: Built-in mechanisms for traceability, auditability, and regulatory adherence.
- **Legacy-Friendly**: Designed for seamless integration with existing enterprise systems.
- **Scalable & Resilient**: Leveraging modern microservices and event-driven architectures.
- **Open Source**: Fostering community collaboration and transparency.
