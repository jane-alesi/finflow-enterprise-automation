# FinFlow Project Overview

This repository contains the FinFlow - Enterprise Financial Workflow Automation Platform.

## Project Vision
To deliver a truly valuable, enterprise-ready, and compliant open-source solution that addresses the real-world challenges faced by financial institutions by automating specific, high-friction, repetitive workflows with measurable KPIs. The goal is to build "forgettably reliable" infrastructure, not generalized, flashy AI.

## Key Principles
- **Workflow-First**: Focus on orchestrating business processes with embedded AI.
- **Compliance-Native**: Built-in auditability and regulatory reporting.
- **Legacy-Friendly**: Seamless integration with existing enterprise systems.
- **AI-Agent Optimized**: Designed for efficient LLM context processing.
